##### How does it work?
Walk up to your stashtab and open it, then press your hotkey (F3) if you have that setting enabled. The plugin will then put all your inventory items in their corresponding tabs. The tab indexes are set by the user via the settings UI. Ignored cells are also featured (code to create the default json int array is credited to kSacred from his Move to Stash plugin).

##### Features as of latest release (B1.0.0):

* Hotkey option
   * Hotkey is hardcoded to F3
* Sorting  
   * Items are ctrl+leftclick'ed in the order the user wants the item sorted by (fx. rarity, name, and so forth)
   * This feature needs to be rewritten into a full stash sorter, so that the tabs can look pretty at all times.
